    <h1>About This Project</h1>

    <div id="about-intro">
      <p>
        Path2FIT is a student-built platform created by the Faculty of
        Information Technology (FIT) students at ASU. Our goal is to help new
        and current students understand the different IT majors, explore real
        roadmaps, and feel confident about their academic and career choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        We built this platform because we once faced the same confusion: “Which
        major should I choose?” “What does AI actually mean?” “What does a
        cybersecurity student do?” and so on. We turned our experience into a
        guide that helps you see everything clearly.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <div id="about-intro">
      <ul type="square">
        <li>Make IT career paths clear and beginner-friendly.</li>
        <li>Provide realistic roadmaps for every FIT major.</li>
        <li>Motivate students through real success stories and guidance.</li>
        <li>Help students feel confident about their future in IT.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
    
    <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px">
      We are proud ASU FIT students who turned our confusion into a platform
      that guides others.
